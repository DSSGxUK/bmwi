# Welcome to BMWi Forecasting Tool


## About the Project 

This project is a collaboration between [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) and [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship, UK](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/). The goal of the project is to robustify BMWIâ€™s forecasts by developing a bottom-up forecasting model for predicting economic development in Germany based on regional data. The bottom-up approach focusses on the predictions at the Kreis (county) level rather than a federal level. The project will draw on fine-grained data on the demographic, economic and sectoral structure of regions with the aim of improving economic forecasts during times of shocks.
