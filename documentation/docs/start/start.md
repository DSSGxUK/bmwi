*We have identified four potential types of users that would benefit from this documentation and tool. If you have a suggestion of another type of user we did not think of, please let us know.*

[ðŸ¤¯ First-time Users](#first-time-users) |
[ðŸ˜Š Experienced Users](#experienced-users) |
[ðŸ˜… Quick Access](#quick-access) |
[ðŸ¤” Technical Users](#technical-users)

**Pro Tip**: Clicking on the blue boxes in the flowchart brings you to the documentation page for that specific step.

## First-time Users

This is a simplified version of the user workflow. You can find the detailed [user workflow](../../start/user/) here.

<!-- <div class="mermaid">
graph LR
    subgraph Dataset Prep page
    A[data input]
    end
    subgraph Model page
    B[prediction]
    end
    subgraph Error Analysis page
    E[compare results]
    end
    subgraph Home page
    F[data story-telling]
    end
    F -.-> A
    A -.-> B
    B -.-> E
    B -.-> F
    click A "https://github.com/prakharrathi25/the-tool-bmwi/blob/main/pages/data_prep.py"
    click B "https://github.com/prakharrathi25/the-tool-bmwi/blob/main/pages/model_v1.py"
    click E "https://github.com/prakharrathi25/the-tool-bmwi/blob/main/pages/error_analysis.py"
    click F "https://github.com/prakharrathi25/the-tool-bmwi/blob/main/pages/home_page.py"
</div>

<br> -->

When you open the tool, the first page you see is the **Home** page.

1. Your prediction journey starts on the **Data Prep** page. There, you upload the data, and do necessary preprocessing that would then feed into the model. [Click here](../data/7444_318010_BMWI_Enkelmann_Eckdaten_Zeitreihe_Kreise.xlsx) to download an Excel file containing data till May 2021. This Excel file contains the format of the input that our tool was tested on.
2. Once you "confirm" the preprocessed data on the **Data Prep** page, you can go to the **Model** page. The preprocessed data from the page before is automatically loaded. The predictions may take a while to run. The prediction results are cached, which means it should run faster the second time you try to predict the same data. 
3. The **Visualizations** page includes line plots and map visualizations to quickly understand the prediction results, e.g. which kreis has the highest unemployment rate, whether the trend for that kreis is going up or down.
4. The **Rankings** page contains kreis-level and grouped rankings of unemployment rates and their percentage changes. 
5. The **Error Analysis** page would be automatically loaded with the prediction results. This page helps you look closer into which kreise were harder to predict, and how that compares with their basic infrastructures, such as number of hospitals, number of schools etc.

Now that you understand what you can expect, visit to the [**Step-By-Step Guide section**]('../steps/home/') of the documentation if necessary. We suggest that you open up the tool on a side-by-side window, so that you can follow and implement along with the guided instruction.

## Experienced Users

If you are an experienced user, you can dive right in the tool!

    style B3 fill:#CAEEFE,stroke:#2596be,color:#063970
</div>

If you are encountering problems, it is likely that the problem and how to solve it is already noted in our documentation. You can visit the specific page in the **Step-By-Step Guide section**.

If you are encountering a problem that is not recorded in our documentation, please let us know.
