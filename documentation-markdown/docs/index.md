# Welcome to BMWi Forecasting Tool

## About the Project 

This project is a collaboration between [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) and [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship, UK](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/). The goal of the project is to build a bottom-up forecasting model for predicting economic development in Germany based on regional data. The bottom-up approach focusses on the predictions at the Kreis (county) level rather than a federal level and provides an alternate approach to forecasting. The project draws on fine-grained data on the demographic, economic and sectoral structure of regions with the aim of improving economic forecasts during times of shocks. The unemployment rate in the different regions of Germany has been used as a proxy for the economic development in that region.
